# TODO
1. Improve the Astrocrash game by creating a new kind of deadly space debris.
Give this new type of debris some quality that differentiates it from the asteroids. For example, maybe the debris requires two missile strikes
to be destroyed.
2. Write a version of the Simon Says game in which a player has to repeat an ever-growing, random sequence of colors and sounds using a keyboard.
3. Write your own version of another classic video game, such as Space Invaders or Pac-Man.
