# Trivia Challenge
# Demonstrates Files and Exceptions
# Trivia game that reads a plain-text file.

# TODO
# 1. Improve the Trivia Challenge game so that each question has a unique
# point value associated with it. The player's score
# should be the total of all the point values of the questions
# he or she answers correctly.
# 2. Improve the Trivia Challenge game so that it maintains a high-scores
# list in a file. The program should record the player's name and score
# if the player makes the list.
# Store the high scores using a pickled object.
# 3. Change the way the high-scores functionality you create in
# the last challenge is implemented. This time, use a plain-text
# file to store the list.
# 4. Create a trivia game that tests the player's knowledge
# of Python files and exceptions
